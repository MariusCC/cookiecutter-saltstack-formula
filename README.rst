Cookiecutter template for a SaltStack Formula.

This is an opinionated template with a solid focus on best practices described in
http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/development/conventions/formulas.html

Usage
-----

Generate a SaltStack formula project::

    cookiecutter https://github.com/slafs/cookiecutter-saltstack-formula.git

Answer few questions about formula name, your name etc.

Then init a repo from the created directory
and put it somewhere (e.g on GitHub or Bitbucket).

See https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter for more documentation about Cookiecutter usage.

Fork This / Create Your Own
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have differences in your preferred setup, I encourage you to fork this
to create your own version. Or create your own; it doesn't strictly have to
be a fork.

It's up to you whether or not to rename your fork/own version. Do whatever
you think sounds good.

Or Submit a Pull Request
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I also accept pull requests on this, if they're small, atomic, and if they
make my own developing experience better.

Example
~~~~~~~

An example of a formula created from this template can be found
here: https://github.com/slafs/example-formula
(i.e. when asked about a formula name I typed ``example``)
